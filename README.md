## Assignment
I read [this](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/) article written by Dan Abramov, the co-author of the well renowned JavaScript state management library, Redux. 

It's a good read because people would believe that since this man wrote a popular and well made library, he would be quite knowledgable. Don't get me wrong - I'm not saying that he's not, but it's nice to know that even creators don't know everything there is to know in the tech industry. 

[Impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) is especially prevalent in tech - there are so many languages, libraries, and frameworks coming out and updating each year that it's nearly impossible to keep up. But Dan validates everyone's fears and anxieties about software engineering. There's really no way to know everything, even if you dedicate your entire life to coding.

I thought that the article was refreshing because we shouldn't have to feel afraid of not knowing technology, but instead be driven by wanting to learn more and being willing to learn from others. I like that he presents the idea that someone who is an experienced engineer doesn't have to know everything; that you can be successful and still have a lot to learn.
